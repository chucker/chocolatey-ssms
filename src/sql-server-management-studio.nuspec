SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of 
graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server.  This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, 
a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

* There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
* Additionally, this version of SSMS can be installed side-by-side with earlier released non-preview versions.

#### Supported Operating systems

This release of SSMS supports the following platforms when used with the latest available service pack:
Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 (SP1), Windows Server 2012 (64-bit), Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit), Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)
